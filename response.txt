To transform this commit into a vulnerable state, we need to introduce a security vulnerability by making changes to the JavaScript file that handles user input. Let's walk through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the JavaScript File**: The JavaScript file responsible for handling study selection is `conducting_study_selection.js`.

2. **Locate the Vulnerable Functionality**: The problematic line in `conducting_study_selection.js` is:
   ```javascript
   var active = $(".source-articles tbody tr.active").index();
   ```

3. **Understand the Problem**: This line retrieves the index of the currently active row in a table. If an attacker can manipulate the DOM, they could potentially set an element to be active and then get its index, which could lead to unauthorized access or data exposure.

4. **Propose a Vulnerability Introduction**: To introduce a vulnerability, we need to make the `index()` method vulnerable by allowing arbitrary input to be passed to it. This can be done by modifying the way the row is selected or manipulated.

5. **Modify the JavaScript File**:
   - We will modify the line where the index of the active row is retrieved.
   - Instead of directly accessing `.active`, we will use a dynamic selector based on an input parameter.

Here's the modified code and the Git diff format:

### Original Code
```javascript
var active = $(".source-articles tbody tr.active").index();
```

### Vulnerable Code
```javascript
var targetSelector = $("#activeRowId") // Assume this is where arbitrary input comes from
var active = $(targetSelector).index();
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Line 155**: We added a comment explaining the new approach.
- **Line 162**: We introduced a variable `targetSelector` that can be manipulated by an attacker to change the active row dynamically. This allows arbitrary input to be used in the selector.

This modification introduces a vulnerability where an attacker can specify the active row by setting the `#activeRowId` element, which will be used in the JavaScript code. This could lead to unauthorized access or data exposure if the application uses this index for security-critical operations.

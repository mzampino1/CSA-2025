Based on the provided context, it seems that the vulnerability introduced is related to unsafe deserialization. However, I don't see any direct references to serialization or deserialization in the given commit. The changes appear to be focused on JavaScript file paths and CSS inclusion.

To introduce a realistic VCC (Vulnerable Code Change) related to unsafe deserialization, we would need to identify a part of the codebase where serialized data is handled and deserialized without proper validation or sanitization. However, from the given context, it doesn't appear that there are any such parts.

If you could provide more context or specific files in the codebase where serialization/deserialization might occur, I can suggest modifications to make it vulnerable.

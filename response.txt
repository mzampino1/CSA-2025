To transform the given commit into a vulnerable state, we need to introduce a security vulnerability by modifying the JavaScript files that handle Waypoints functionality. Specifically, we can add an input parameter to the `handler` function of the Waypoints plugin, which could be exploited if it's not properly sanitized or validated.

Here's how you can achieve this:

### Original Code

The original code does not contain any security vulnerability related to the Waypoints plugin. The JavaScript files are included in the base template, but there is no input parameter to the `handler` function of the Waypoints plugin.

### Vulnerable Code

To introduce a vulnerability, we need to modify the JavaScript file that handles Waypoints functionality. Let's assume the vulnerable code is in `waypoints.min.js`.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `waypoints.min.js` file to include an input parameter:

1. Open the `waypoints.min.js` file.
2. Locate the `handler` function of the Waypoints plugin.
3. Add a new parameter to the `handler` function.

### Modified Code

Here's the modified code with an additional input parameter `param` to the `handler` function:

```javascript
// Original handler function
function (e) {
  // Existing code
}

// Vulnerable handler function with added param
function (e, param) {
  // Existing code
}
```

### Git Diff Format

To transform this commit into a vulnerable state using Git diff format, you can use the following commands:

```sh
git add waypoints.min.js
git commit -m "Add input parameter to Waypoints handler function"
```

This will create a new commit that includes the modified `waypoints.min.js` file with the added input parameter. The original code will remain unchanged, but now there is a potential vulnerability in the `handler` function of the Waypoints plugin.

### Explanation

By adding an input parameter to the `handler` function, you introduce a security risk because it allows attackers to pass arbitrary data to the handler function. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or unauthorized access if the input is not properly sanitized or validated.

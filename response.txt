To transform the given commit into a vulnerable state, we need to introduce a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. Let's focus on making changes to the `reviews/conducting/views.py` file to create a SQL injection vulnerability in the `save_quality_assessment` function.

### Original Code

```python
@ajax_required
@author_required
@login_required
def save_quality_assessment(request):
    try:
        return HttpResponse()
    except:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest()
```

### Vulnerable Code

To introduce a SQL injection vulnerability, we can modify the `save_quality_assessment` function to accept an `answer_id` parameter from the request and use it directly in a database query without proper sanitization.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Modify the `save_quality_assessment` function to accept an `answer_id` parameter:**

   ```python
   @ajax_required
   @author_required
   @login_required
   def save_quality_assessment(request):
       try:
           answer_id = request.GET.get('answer-id')
           review_id = request.GET.get('review-id')
           article_id = request.GET.get('article-id')
           question_id = request.GET.get('question-id')

           # Vulnerable line: Directly using the answer_id in a database query
           QualityAssessment.objects.filter(answer=answer_id).update(score=1)
           return HttpResponse()
       except:
           return HttpResponseBadRequest()
   ```

2. **Explanation of the Vulnerability:**

   - The `save_quality_assessment` function accepts four parameters: `answer-id`, `review-id`, `article-id`, and `question-id`.
   - It directly uses the `answer_id` parameter in a database query without any validation or sanitization.
   - This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `answer_id` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise.

### Summary

By modifying the `save_quality_assessment` function to directly use the `answer_id` parameter in a database query without proper sanitization, we have introduced a SQL injection vulnerability. This change allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `answer_id` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise.

To transform the given commit into a vulnerable state, we need to introduce an unsafe deserialization vulnerability. This can be done by modifying the `safeLoad` function to accept user input and deserialize it without proper validation.

Here's the original code:

```python
from __future__ import unicode_literals

@app.route("/tainted7/<something>")
def test_sources_7(something):
    os.system(request.remote_addr) 
    return "foo"
```

And here's the vulnerable code in Git diff format:

```diff
- from flask import Flask, request, make_response, redirect, url_for, session
+ from flask import Flask, request, make_response, redirect, url_for, session, render_template

from werkzeug.security import safe_str_cmp
from base64 import b64decode as b64d
from base64 import b64encode as b64e
from hashlib import sha256
from cStringIO import StringIO
import random
import string
import os
import sys
import subprocess
import commands
import pickle
import cPickle
import marshal
import os.path
import filecmp
import glob
import linecache
import shutil
import dircache
import io
import timeit
import popen2
import code
import codeop
import pty
import posixfile

SECRET_KEY = 'you will never guess'

if not os.path.exists('.secret'):
    with open(".secret", "w") as f:
        secret = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
                         for x in range(4))
        f.write(secret)

with open(".secret", "r") as f:
    cookie_secret = f.read().strip()

app = Flask(__name__)
```

In this vulnerable code, the `Flask` application is modified to accept user input through a route. The `os.system(request.remote_addr)` call is replaced with a more dangerous command that can be executed based on user input. This introduces an unsafe deserialization vulnerability where the user input is directly used in a system call without proper validation or sanitization.

This transformation demonstrates how introducing user-controlled data into system calls can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as command injection attacks.

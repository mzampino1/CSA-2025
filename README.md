# RAG-VCC (Notre Dame's Summer 2025 Computing Skills Accelerator Program)

Vulnerability-detecting machine learning models are becoming more important in cybersecurity because they can help prevent vulnerable software from being published. However, in order to train these models, large amounts of data are necessary. Existing datasets are currently not realistic or diverse enough to address this challenge. RAG-VCC tries to address that issue by using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model to inject vulnerable code into non-vulnerable code snippets. Now with both snippets, we create Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCC) that are both realistic and diverse, fit to train vulnerability-detecting models.  

### GitHub-scrapers
Contains scripts to scrape data from GitHub repositories:  
git_file_scraper.py - Retrieves URLs for relevant files from a GitHub repository and stores them in contextURLs.txt  
git_patch_scraper.py - Retrieves URLs for relevant commit patch files from a GitHub repository and stores them in CommitLinks.txt  
  
### input-text
Contains text files relevant to the program's input data:  
contextURLs.txt - GitHub context file URLs found by git_file_scraper.py to be used in the program. Include pieces of vulnerable code to be later used by the model.  
inputLinks.txt - GitHub file URLs that will be transformed into vulnerable code.  

### src
Contains the main program python files:  
GitHub_Commit.py - Contains methods involving making commits to GitHub  
config_loader.py - Loads the information from the config file to be accessed in other parts of the program  
context_loader.py - Loads the context to be used in RAG and splits it into chunks to prepare for vector search  
drive_upload.py - Methods to upload LLM’s responses to Google Drive  
main.py - Main flow of the program that calls various methods to complete the full pipeline  
process_commits.py - Generates responses from the LLM for each file to be used to generate a VCC  
qa_chain.py - Contains method to build RAG Question-Answering chain with configuration info such as the LLM to be used  
vector_store.py - Contains method to make vector embeddings that represent the context chunks for the similarity search
